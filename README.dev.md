## Adding a metadata owner

If you want to display a logo for a specific owner you must add the logo in png format in:

src/Cartong/MSFBundle/Resources/public/images/

With the following file name:

logo-<owner>.png
(where <owner> must be replaced by the name you have entered in Genetwork)

## Paper size

The paper size (aka format) is stored in:

    //gmd:denominator/gco:Integer
